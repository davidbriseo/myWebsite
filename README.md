# My Website üåê

### What is this?
This is my portafolio website, here is where any recruiting team can come and take a look to what I've done and why I'm the man for the job. This is a compilation of my skills and what I can do as a frontend developer.

### Why are you doing this?
This project is to simulate real work enviroment for a junior developer, it's an opportunity to experiment what it'll be like having a daily meeting in the Scrum methodology context, having reviews and tasks every day. Also I'm going to stumble my way into working with git and GitHub, my reviewer is a ruthless senior backend developer [Mario Brise√±o](https://github.com/marioabz).

### Can I check it out?
You can see how the website is going [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

But we are not in need of any help.
